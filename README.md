# mago23's Neovim Configuration

This is a personal Neovim configuration, built on top of the excellent [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) starter. It's tailored for a productive and visually pleasing development experience, with a focus on web development (TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Astro) and general purpose programming.

  * **üß† Smart Editing**: Enhanced LSP support for auto-completion, diagnostics, and code actions. Includes configurations for TailwindCSS, TypeScript, CSS, and more.
  * **üå≤ Advanced Treesitter**: Robust syntax highlighting and text objects.
  * **üî≠ Powerful Search**: Pre-configured [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) for finding files, text, buffers, and more, with an integrated file browser.
  * **ü§ñ AI-Assisted Coding**: Integrated with [Copilot](https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot.lua) for code suggestions.
  * **‚úÖ Quality Tools**: Linting and formatting set up with `eslint` and `prettier`.

## üìã Prerequisites
